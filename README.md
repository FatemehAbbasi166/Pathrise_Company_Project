# Insights from the Inside: Analyzing Pathrise Company Data for Career Guidance
Pathrise is an online program offering 1-on-1 mentorship, training, and guidance to help individuals secure top-tier tech jobs. New cohorts are admitted every two weeks, and successful candidates entering a free trial period can withdraw without penalty during the first 2 weeks. After this trial, participants sign an Income Share Agreement (ISA) to continue in the year-long program, which includes an 8-week core curriculum. If a fellow doesn't secure a job within a year, their contract is terminated, with exceptions for breaks. On average, those staying beyond the trial take about 4 months to receive a job offer, but outcomes vary. Predicting individual job search durations is crucial, and the provided dataset captures imperfect but valuable information from fellows since they joined the program.
