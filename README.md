# Insights from the Inside: Analyzing Pathrise Company Data for Career Guidance
Pathrise is an online program offering 1-on-1 mentorship, training, and guidance to help individuals secure top-tier tech jobs. New cohorts are admitted every two weeks, and successful candidates entering a free trial period can withdraw without penalty during the first 2 weeks. After this trial, participants sign an Income Share Agreement (ISA) to continue in the year-long program, which includes an 8-week core curriculum. If a fellow doesn't secure a job within a year, their contract is terminated, with exceptions for breaks. On average, those staying beyond the trial take about 4 months to receive a job offer, but outcomes vary. Predicting individual job search durations is crucial, and the provided dataset captures imperfect but valuable information from fellows since they joined the program.
## The primary objectives of the analysis are twofold:

###Predicting Fellow Placement:

The analysis aims to provide insights into the likelihood of a fellow being successfully placed at a company. By leveraging the available dataset, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the probability of a fellow securing a job placement within the Pathrise program.

###Placement Time Prediction:

Another key focus is on predicting the duration it takes for a fellow to secure a job placement within the program. The analysis seeks to understand the factors influencing the time it takes for individuals to transition from joining Pathrise to successfully landing a job, allowing for the estimation of placement time.
By addressing these goals, the analysis aims to enhance the understanding of the placement outcomes for fellows in the Pathrise program, providing valuable insights for both program improvement and the expectations of prospective participants.
