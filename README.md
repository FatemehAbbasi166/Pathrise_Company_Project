# Insights from the Inside: Analyzing Pathrise Company Data for Career Guidance
Pathrise is an online program offering 1-on-1 mentorship, training, and guidance to help individuals secure top-tier tech jobs. New cohorts are admitted every two weeks, and successful candidates entering a free trial period can withdraw without penalty during the first 2 weeks. After this trial, participants sign an Income Share Agreement (ISA) to continue in the year-long program, which includes an 8-week core curriculum. If a fellow doesn't secure a job within a year, their contract is terminated, with exceptions for breaks. On average, those staying beyond the trial take about 4 months to receive a job offer, but outcomes vary. Predicting individual job search durations is crucial, and the provided dataset captures imperfect but valuable information from fellows since they joined the program.
The main goal of your analysis is to derive insights around if a fellow will
ultimately be placed at a company and how long until a placement can be
expected.
